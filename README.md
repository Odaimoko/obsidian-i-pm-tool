*Tag Project* extends [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), gives you freedom to manage
projects and track progress anywhere in your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault.

*Tag Project* is developed with *Tag Project*!

The tutorials and template are also available in the plugin's Help Page, directly accessible in Obsidian.

Github will not render these pages correctly. Please visit Help Page in Obsidian for readability.

## Inspiration / Design Philosophy

When I was working on my indie game, I usually found that there are a whole lot of things to track:

- 20 monsters
- 12 chapters
- 21 game features
- ...

For every monster, I need to design it's

- skills
- action patterns
- art
- ...

For every newly added feature, I need to work on its

- implementation
- playtest
- unit test

Yep, gamedev is this pipelined.
And I write them everywhere in my vault. My ideas float a lot.

No Obsidian plugin solves the combination of the following problems

- Tasks are spread across the vault
- But I want to manage them in a single page
- Each task belongs to certain pre-defined workflow
- There are plenty of tasks with the same workflow
- Workflows and tasks should be easily defined and assigned

Fine, I'll do it myself.

Here's a screenshot of the tasks I created with *Tag Project* when developing it.
