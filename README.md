# Inspiration / Design Philosophy

No Obsidian plugin solves the combination of the following problems

- Tasks are spread across the vault
- But I want to manage them in a single page
- Each task belongs to certain pre-defined workflow
- There are plenty of tasks with the same workflow
- Workflows and tasks should be easily defined and assigned

Fine, I'll do it myself.

Here's a screenshot of the tasks I created with *Tag Project* when developing it.
